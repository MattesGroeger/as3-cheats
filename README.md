AS3 Cheats
==================

This library provides an easy way to handle cheats within flash. Register a key combination or phrase to a cheat and it gets then triggered by the library.

**Use cases for this library:**

- Enable certain functionalities in live environments which should be normally deactivated (e.g. logging)
- Use cheats within games or as easter egg triggers
- Persist cheats so you don't have to re-enter them again and again
